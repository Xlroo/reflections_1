What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden file with .git is created 
Git highllights files as untracked 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area works like an escrow that allows one to revert to previous
work done before commiting changes to the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Compare the difference between the staging area and either working directory 
or repository to make sure that the changes are not too big.
