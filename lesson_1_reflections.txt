How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

It helped me see what changes were made and where they were made.
Knowing this helps me to revert to previous version if need be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having easy access to entire history helps me make corrections update 
functions and refactor code easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro's : Autonomy , Prevent illogical commits 
Con's : May forget to commit 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Function : Git serves programmers who would need that function while google
docs is a corporate tool.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log [ to view all commits ]
git diff ID1 ID2 [to view the difference between commit ID 1 and 2]
